# dijkstra-algorithm
Visualisation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in Python, using networkx and matplotlib modules.

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a given vertex to all other vertices in a certain graph, or to a specified final destination (vertex).

It is an example of a greedy algorithm - it makes the local optimal choice at each step in attempt to find the best solving pattern.

Dijkstra is utilised in, including, but not limited to:
- mapping and navigation - to find the shortest path from e.g., one city to another
- social media networks - suggesting people who the user may know
- telephone networks - directing phone calls through paths with the highest bandwidths
- network routing - finding the optimal paths for transfer after packet switching.
